# Flutter Starter CLI

The `Flutter Starter CLI` is a very useful tool that provides commands for the ease of setting up a Flutter project from scratch.

## Introduction

`Flutter Starter CLI` is written in the Dart programming language.\
While working with the Flutter projects we have to write the same repetitive code multiple times but using this CLI, we can create a Flutter template on the fly.\
Also, the basic structure of all the tests in Flutter is the same. So this CLI also provides a basic starter pack for the Flutter test as well.

Out of the box, `Flutter Starter CLI` includes:-

- ✅ **State Management**
  - BLoC - BLoC is a popular design/architectural pattern that is used to separate the logic from the UI.
  - Riverpod - (Coming Soon... 🥳)
- ✅ **API-Services**
  - Dio - A powerful HTTP client for Dart, which supports Interceptors, Global configuration, FormData, Request Cancellation, File downloading, Timeout etc.
  - Http - A composable, Future-based library for making HTTP requests.
- ✅ **Basic Setup**
  - Themes - Themes are used to share colors and font styles throughout an app.
  - Localization - The project provides support for multiple languages like English, Spanish and French.
  - Routing - Go_Router is used to provide a convenient, URL-based API for navigating between different screens.
- ✅ **Testing**
  - Unit - A unit test tests a single function, method, or class.
  - Widget - A widget test tests a single widget.
  - Integration - An integration test tests a complete app or a large part of an app.

## Getting Started

Firstly clone the project on your system then run the following command:

```sh
dart pub global activate --source=path <path_to_this_project>
```

## Usage

In the root of your application, run the following commands:

```sh
# Show CLI version
$ flutter_starter_cli --version
```

```sh
# Show usage help
$ flutter_starter_cli --help
```

```sh
# To create project
$ flutter_starter_cli create

# Then follow instructions
```

```sh
# Shorthand to create project with git
$ flutter_starter_cli create <project_name> --api=<api_service> -g

# Shorthand to create project with test
$ flutter_starter_cli create <project_name> --api=<api_service> -t

# Shorthand to create project without git and test
$ flutter_starter_cli create <project_name> --api=<api_service>

# Available API services (dio, http)
```

## Complete Usage

The complete usage of the create command with options and flags.

```sh
